# FsCheck - There and Back Property Tests

Properties are found in `properties.fsx`.

## Running the Code

On Windows, execute:

    build.cmd

On Mac, execute:

    ./build.sh

The build will create the binaries in the `artifacts/` directory. Running the build will
also execute the properties. If any properties should fail the build will fail as well.

## Properties

The properties are located in `properties.fsx`.
